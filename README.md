## Brief 🗒️
### What is "Metodologías de Desarrollo de Proyectos"? 🌐

This is a **web page** 🌐 that includes information of various technology project development methodologies 📊.

In it are the famous approaches (**Traditional** and **Agile**) and their main methodologies are exposed.

Its functionality, advantages, components or stages are explained for each methodology and, above all, it is about explaining **what type of projects are adapted to each one** for greater feasibility.

The raison d'être of this project is that people who are in the process of starting a technology project have an **easily accessible site** that concentrates various options for methodologies and makes it **easier to choose** one of them.

## Product Design 🧩 

This project was developed with two **principles** in mind:
- **Accessibiliy:** The web must be usable for anybody and must be *perceptible*, *operable*, *understandable* and *robust*.
- **Consistent:** The web must have the same goal on all of his sections and speak the same way (both visually and written).
   
Some important **foundations** that are important to remark are:
- **Typography:** The web uses the popular font **"Poppins"** of Google Fonts in three different weights (regular, bold and extrabold) used for headings `h1,h2,h3`, label's text and normal text `p`.
- **Colors:** The web uses a yellow color palette (as brand color) and variations of white for background (in two levels) and variations of black for the text.
- **Voice and Tone:** The web uses a neutral tone in spanish and is user centered. It is allowed to use emojis in catch phrases and descriptive paragraphs.
- **Layout:** The desing is **Mobile First** because this web is oritend to be used as a quick tool for the people so it must have the info distributed with margin and padding with enough size to focus readers. 

This foundations can be accesible on the [🧩UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/xCcXr7QB0ToLkBs1AKOX5N/Project-Methodologies?node-id=16%3A197) page on the Figma Project.

For the UX design it was developed and prototyped a [📝WireFrame Mobile](https://www.figma.com/file/xCcXr7QB0ToLkBs1AKOX5N/Project-Methodologies?node-id=0%3A1) and subsequently for the UI were designed some atoms and components that were placed on the Hi Fidelity designs for [📱Mobile](https://www.figma.com/file/xCcXr7QB0ToLkBs1AKOX5N/Project-Methodologies?node-id=22%3A145), [📳Tablet](https://www.figma.com/file/xCcXr7QB0ToLkBs1AKOX5N/Project-Methodologies?node-id=39%3A327) and [🖥️Desktop](https://www.figma.com/file/xCcXr7QB0ToLkBs1AKOX5N/Project-Methodologies?node-id=68%3A688).
